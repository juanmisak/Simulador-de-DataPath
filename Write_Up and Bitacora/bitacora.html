        <h1>Pipeline Simulator</h1>
        <p>(05/08/13) <br /> Juan Mite,Esteban Muñoz <br /> On the first day we discussed how we should treat the problem so that does not become too difficult to implement and would use technological tools, we decided that before we should be clear all the theory related to the project or pipeline, we also define when serious the next meeting (08/08/13) and which would begin to implement the view for the application.</p>
        <p>(08/08/13) <br /> Juan Mite,Esteban Muñoz <br /> On this day we began working with the hearing of the application, the workplace was in the central library, define the structure of the view and the components in which the end user interacts with the application, we inserted a TextArea where you can instructions write a play button which will run the simulation, a pause button and a stop to finish running, there is also a ComboBox which displays options for the simulation solution, which can be Hazards, solution NOP, and finally an area where anger showing the execution of the simulation.</p>
        <p>(12/08/13) <br /> Juan Mite,Esteban Muñoz <br /> Once defined as the interface where the user can interact with the simulator, we started doing a class in JavaScript which identifies the type of instruction that the user enters in the TextArea thank defined as basicInstructionFormats function that receives as a parameter the operation entering the user and returns the type of format, also created functions to find the opcode of each operation which will be used later to see how you should handle the various hazards that may exist in that code. </p>
        <p>(15/08/13) <br /> Juan Mite,Esteban Muñoz <br /> Once the above tasks are created in the constructor in class Instruction of javaScript, which receives as a parameter the user line in TextArea income then that string is separated into tokens to separate the type of instruction and records are being used and then to be drawing instructions are inserted into the TextArea right through a canvas. </p>
		<p>(19/08/13) <br /> Juan Mite,Esteban Muñoz <br /> We started looking for images to simulate the pipeline that is generated for each line of code, once done loadMedia create a function in the main.js filed which allows you to draw the part of the IF / ID / EXE / MEM / WB for instructional, also made the function to draw the hazards, it should be noted that before this became an investigation of how to use canvas in JavaScript that is what we are using to draw the graphics. </p>
		<p>(21/08/13) <br /> Juan Mite,Esteban Muñoz <br /> We continue with the implementation of main.js file as mentioned above the application interface are three buttons that allow interaction with the user, the button ? play, stop, and clear ? capture.It started with the implementation of each of these buttons became a little simpler because we had major roles, but as everything is not rosy, the problems started. One of the most difficult problems to solve was the coordination of the movements in the simulation for each line of code that was written was to know the coordinates to draw the next pipeline, so that is not mounted to each other. </p>
		<p>(22/08/13) <br /> Juan Mite,Esteban Muñoz <br /> Continuing the implementation of the stop buttons, capture and play the culaes were not very difficult to implement, once done modify the html file to connect the events of the buttons with the functions implemented in JavaScript and complete simulation test. Which we can realize the input values into fields following the error even relocating the layaut simulation showed that by changing values in the function and finally solved the problem and I can do well the simulation . </p>
		<p>(23/08/13) <br /> Juan Mite,Esteban Muñoz <br /> We implemented a part that was missing in the project was the solution for NOPS and for which we overwrite one works we had today and housed some parameters in it, the same way again had a small problem with the simulation, but it all stay as it should be. </p>
